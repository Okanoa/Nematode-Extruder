| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1x | LF-840ZZ | |
| 2x | 4mm/0.5mm shim | |
| 2x | 5mm/0.5mm shim | |
| 1x | m4x16mm pin | |
| 1x | m5x16mm pin | |
| 1x | 625zz | |
| 1x | creality k1 extruder gears | |
| 1x | SW0.5-R1 or SW0.5-R2 | |

R1 worm provides higher 30:1 ratio, Single start will likely wear faster but provide more extursion force.
Testing was able to push 84^3mm/s of Polymaker Asa through a 0.5 TC nozzle at 260c

R2 worm provides lower 15:1 ratio, Double start likely has less wear but also provides a little less extrusion force.
Testing was able to push 60^3mm/s of Polymaker Asa through a 0.5 TC nozzle at 260c
